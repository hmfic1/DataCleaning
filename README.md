# Getting and Cleaning Data
## Final Project
### February, 2016

####   Backgroud
This project takes data from experiments performed by Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, and Luca Oneto of the Universit√† degli Studi di Genova.

The experiments were carried out with a group of 30 volunteers, age 19-48. Each volunteer performed six activities (Walking, Walking Upstairs, Walking Downstairs, Sitting, Standing, and Laying) wearing a Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone on the waist. Using the embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, the project team captured linear acceleration and angular velocity on three axes. 

The project team then derived body linear acceleration and angular velocity from these readings. In addition, the magnitude of the three dimensional signals were calculated. Subsequently, a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of the signals to to produce other variables. The signals were used to estimate variables for each pattern. 

See the codebook (CodeBook.md) for a list of the variables provided ("Measure").

Data was randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

####    Project 

The goal of the Getting and Cleaning Data project is to demonstrate techniques for extracting data from the internet, reshaping the data, and tidying it to provide a format easily used for subsequent analysis.

The run_analysis.R script reads the data provided subsets it, selecting only the mean and standard deviation variables. The script then manipulates the data to combine the test and training data and to add appropriate varable names. 

The script groups the data and summarizes it to create a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity for each subject, putting the final data into a format ready for further evaluation.

The script writes out the tidy data set to SamsungFile.txt in the user's R Studio working directory.


####    Running the R script

Before running the run_analysis.R script:
  
* Ensure that you have an internet connection established
* Open R Studio
* Ensure that you have the following packages installed: plyr, dplyr, tidyr
* Set your working directory to the directory of your choice
* Open the run_analysis.R script in R Studio

This script will download the raw data into the current working directory. It will then unzip the data.

The script will perform various functions to merge data from the training and test files. It will then tidy the data by grouping and summarizing using tidyr functions.

The script cleans up after itself. Data files downloaded (and unzipped) are eventually deleted. Additionally, the environment is cleaned of objects by the use of the rm(list=ls()) command at the end of the script.

Before cleaning the environment, the script will write the data out to a text file. The test file name will be SamsungFile.txt.
